# whereby-commander-life-counter

## Purpose of this project
The goal of this extension is to make commander players who use whereby.com for online games lives easier. Since keeping track of life via webcam can be a pain, I wanted to provide an easy-to-use way of managing life. This extension provides **+1** and **-1** buttons to quickly handle life changes. 

This project is currently in an early alpha state. It is provided in the simplest form I thought possible.
